📘 Factorial Calculator Project

📖 Description

🔢 This project reads 6 integers from user input and calculates the factorial of each number. 

⚡ Factorials are computed using a recursive method for clarity and practice.

💻 Results are displayed directly in the console.


🛠 Features

Input exactly 6 numbers from the user.

Recursive method to calculate factorials.

Display factorial results for each entered number.

💻 How to Run

Open the project in Visual Studio or any C# IDE.

Copy the code into a .cs file.

Run the program.

Enter 6 integers when prompted.

The program will print the factorial of each number.

🧮 Example Output

Enter 6 numbers:

Number 1: 3

Number 2: 4

Number 3: 5

Number 4: 6

Number 5: 7

Number 6: 8

Factorials of entered numbers:

Factorial of 3 = 6

Factorial of 4 = 24

Factorial of 5 = 120

Factorial of 6 = 720
